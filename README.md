# From Playboy Cricketer to Islamist Politician? 
## An Analysis of Imran Khan's Tweets Pre and Post Aug 2018

### Background
Former captain of Pakistan’s cricket team, Oxford graduate, ex-husband of a British billionaire tycoon’s daughter and a friend of Princess Diana’s, Imran Khan was known in Pakistan and around the world as a cricket hero, playboy and a sex symbol in the 90s and the early 2000s. Khan created his own political party in 1996, and in 2018, Khan, a self-proclaimed liberal was elected as Pakistan’s Prime Minister.

As Prime Minister, he stressed on Islam being the fulcrum of the Pakistani state and society. Some people however, think that he is a political opportunist using religion (Islam) to appeal to Pakistan’s majority (approximately 96%) Muslim population.

### Theory of Interest
One aspect of exploring whether Imran Khan is using religion strategically i.e. to appeal to the people, is to analyze his “religious tweets” (i.e. tweets with any religious elements) over time. It is important to note here that by religious tweets I do not mean tweets that only talk about religion. I also mean tweets that use religious phrases and elements e.g. a tweet talking about the Kashmir issue containing religious words. The reason why I want to consider the latter as well is because even the use of a few religious terms in otherwise non-religious tweets still signals to readers that religion is important to Imran Khan.

***1. Has the number of Imran Khan’s tweets that contain religious (specifically Islamic) elements increased over time?***
***2. Have Imran Khan’s (religious) tweets become more religious over time?***
